pic30-eclipse
=============

A PIC30 tool-chain plugin for Eclipse.

Well that more or less describes it pretty well. If you're interested in using
it just download the binary package, if you want to contribute, you are very
welcome. The plugin is still very unfinished and lacks a LOT of features that
make it usable to a wider audience, but the time that I can spend improving it
is limited to say the least.
